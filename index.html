      <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
      <p>Hello! Welcome to my website, my name is MRANOMALY. I basically make games and music.</p>
      <p>But I will sometimes do other things on here that I want to, so basically this is my personal website.</p>
      <p>This is not a portfolio please do not look here if you're a corporation</p>

      <h1>About Your Data (and ads)</h1>
      <p>This website hates ads and data collection as much as you, which is why I will not put ads on this website</p>
      <p>or anything that collects any kind of personal information, I am not Facebook (who even uses Facebook anymore?)</p>
      <p>This is just a simple website that I made for fun and to share my work.</p>
      <h1>This is a "personal" website</h1>
      <p>And by "personal" I mean it's for my personal stuff and my MRANOMALY Games stuff so yes it's technically work and personal</p>
      <p>But this is not a place to work, it's just a single person thing I done</p>
      <p>If you want to see my work please go to the mystuff page (currently has nothing on it).</p>
      <p>And if you want to contact me please go to the contact page (currently has the ANOMALY Games Twitter/X page and the proton mail account).</p>
